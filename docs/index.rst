Welcome to Inelastica's documentation!
======================================

Inelastica is both the name of this whole `Python`_ package as well as that of an included script to compute inelastic transport characteristics.
Inelastica is based on the `SIESTA`_/`TranSIESTA`_ DFT codes.

The latest release can obtained `here <releases_>`_ and the development version through:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/tfrederiksen/inelastica.git


History
-------
The project was initiated around 2003-2005 by Thomas Frederiksen and Magnus Paulsson while they worked in the group of Mads Brandbyge at the Technical University of Denmark.
Inelastica was originally hosted at `SourceForge <inelastica-old_>`_ but moved to `GitHub <inelastica_>`_ in February 2018.

Features
--------

Inelastica contains a number of scripts such as:

 * **geom2geom**: Geometry conversion between different file formats
 * **Bandstructures**: Computation of electron and phonon band structures
 * **pyTBT**: A Python version of tbtrans for elastic electron transport
 * **EigenChannels**: Eigenchannel analysis and generation of real-space scattering state wave functions
 * **Phonons**: Vibration modes/frequencies and electron-vibration couplings
 * **Inelastica**: Inelastic transport characteristics (IETS spectroscopy, inelastic shot noise, local heating, etc.)
 * **STM**: Calculation of STM images using the Bardeen approximation


Contributions, issues and bugs
------------------------------

Contributions are highly appreciated.

If you find any bugs please form a `bug report/issue <issue_>`_.

If you have a fix please consider adding a `pull request <pr_>`_.
